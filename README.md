Your project's `readme` is as important to success as your code. For

this reason you should put as much care into its creation and maintenance

as you would any other component of the application.

  

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article,

written by an experienced Chingu, be your starting point -

[Keys to a well written README](https://tinyurl.com/yk3wubft).

  

And before we go there's "one more thing"! Once you decide what to include

in your `readme` feel free to replace the text we've provided here.
